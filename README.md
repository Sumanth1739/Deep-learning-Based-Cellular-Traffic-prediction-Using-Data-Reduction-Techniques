# Deep-learning-Based-Cellular-Traffic-prediction-Using-Data-Reduction-Techniques

Estimating and analyzing traffic patterns is essential for ensuring Quality of Service (QoS) in cellular networks. Existing traffic prediction algorithms often depend on large datasets, leading to high computational cost and time complexity. To address this challenge, we propose ADL-CTP (Adaptive Deep Learning-based Cellular Traffic Prediction), a novel algorithm designed to achieve accurate predictions using a  representative dataset. The proposed methodology incorporates Min-Max normalization, feature selection with Select-K-Best, and PCA-based dimensionality reduction, followed by density-based clustering techniques (DBSCAN and Kernel Density) to enhance training efficiency. Multiple machine learning and deep learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Light Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), will be evaluated using a Cellular LTE dataset. The objective of this work is to identify the most effective model for cellular traffic prediction, aiming to balance accuracy with reduced computational complexity. This research is expected to provide valuable insights for network planning and QoS management in modern cellular systems.
