# **Machine Learning-Based Cellular Traffic Prediction Using Data Reduction Techniques**

## 📌 **About the Project**

Predicting traffic patterns in cellular networks is **crucial** for ensuring smooth connectivity and maintaining **Quality of Service (QoS)**.
The problem?
Most existing solutions rely on **huge datasets**, which makes them **slow, expensive, and computationally heavy**.

That’s where our project, **ML-CTP (Machine Learning-based Cellular Traffic Prediction)**, comes in.
Our goal is simple:
✅ **Predict cellular traffic accurately**
✅ **Reduce complexity and speed up the process**

---

## 🚀 **What We’re Doing**

We’re building an **intelligent prediction system** that uses **data reduction + machine learning** to strike the perfect balance between **accuracy and efficiency**. Here’s how:

### ✅ **Step 1: Preprocessing the Data**

* **Normalize features** with **Min-Max scaling**
* **Pick the best features** using **Select-K-Best**
* **Shrink dimensions** with **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**

### ✅ **Step 2: Smarter Data Grouping**

* Use **DBSCAN** for density-based clustering
* Apply **Kernel Density Estimation** to understand data distribution

### ✅ **Step 3: Train & Compare Models**

We’ll try out multiple models to see which one performs best:

* **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
* **Decision Tree**
* **LightGBM**
* **XGBoost**
* *(and maybe more!)*

---

## 🎯 **Why Are We Doing This?**

* To **reduce computational cost** without sacrificing accuracy
* To help **network providers plan better** and **deliver better QoS**
* To make prediction **faster and more scalable for real-world systems**

---

## 📂 **Dataset**

We’ll be using a **Cellular LTE dataset** for training and testing.
(Details and download link coming soon.)

---

## ✅ **What You’ll Get**

* Smarter, faster traffic predictions
* Insights that can improve **network performance and user experience**
* A framework that can be adapted for **5G and future networks**

---

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**

* **Python** for implementation
* **Scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**, **LightGBM** for ML
* **NumPy**, **Pandas** for data handling
* **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for visualization
* **DBSCAN**, **PCA**, **Select-K-Best** for feature and cluster analysis

---

## 🔮 **Future Plans**

* Add **deep learning models** like **LSTM** for time-series prediction
* Integrate with **real-time cellular data**
* Extend for **5G and IoT networks**
